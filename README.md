An AI problem statement to be solved as a solution designer/architect.

# problem statment

Requirements:
1. We are an enterprise with around 500 vendors (Domestic and International)
2. We receive on an average 1000 invoices from existing and new vendors every month (75% existing
and 25% new vendors. Plus there are around 200 petty cash/small ad hoc invoices)
3. These invoices are mostly received as Paper Invoices delivered through post or by hand or Image/PDF
files in mail
4. The Data Entry operations are currently done manually
5. Once the invoices details are entered in excel sheets they have to be reviewed by the accounts team.
The accounts team has to be informed through mail about new invoices for review. Reviews/rework
happen over mail chains
6. One reviewed, the excel sheet is used to create an invoice into ERP system
7. We want to automate the End to End process, using latest technologies like AI/ML
8. Main points are :
a. Manual process is time consuming and error prone
b. No visibility on where an invoice is in its journey or how many invoices are in the pipeline
c. All communications about reviews and updates are locked in emails
d. The invoices have to be pushed to processors (users) manually. Team utilization is not
optimum as we are not aware of the load on each processor
e. Not able to track the efficiency of processors
f. Last minute rush towards the month closing requires extra working hours

# Goal:
Design a software solution to automate the Invoice Processing End to End ( From extracting details from invoice
to creating Invoice in ERP.). The solution should be able to track the invoice throughout the journey. Should
have review and approval flows. The processors activity should be load balanced.
Please submit a document detailing out your solution. The document should include:
1. To Be Process Flow
2. Major Features explained in details
3. Screen flow/Wireframes (for critical flows/Screens)
4. Solution benefit analysis
5. Future improvements

# Delivery
1. Solution design doc
2. C3-Diagrams for process flow
3. Flow chart for the automating Invoice
$. UML diagram
